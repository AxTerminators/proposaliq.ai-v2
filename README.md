# Proposal IQ
This is another project I built to help government contractors generate proposals. 
I got pretty close to launching it, but decided to go a different direction.

It was built on Base44. 
I'm making it available to the public for anyone who wants to work with it, improve on it, fork it or pull it for your own use.

Give me your thougths on this proposal generating app. 

If you do use it, let me know how it goes with your version or improvements to the app.
