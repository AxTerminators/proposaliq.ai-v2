# Proposal IQ
This is another project I built to help government contractors generate proposals. 
I got pretty close to launching it, but decided to go a different direction.

It was built on Base44. 
At the time that I was using B44, it was not mature enough for me, so I moved to use more mature tools.

If you do use this, you'll need to build out an integration with Openrouter or LiteLLM to use your own LLM API keys fort the proposal generation.

Currently, it is using B44 API LLM integration which will not work. You'll need to code in your own integration to one of the LLM models.
base44.integrations.Core.InvokeLLM

I'm making these codes available to the public for anyone who wants to work with it, improve on it, fork it or pull it for your own use.

Give me your thougths on this proposal generating app. 

If you do use it, let me know how it goes with your version or improvements to the app.
